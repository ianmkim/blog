      <description>Introduction The foundations of libertarian ideology are intuitive and require little justification: Individuals own themselves, they own their labor, and they own justly acquired property. These seem like excellent foundations for a political ideology. Yet, it doesn’t seem to account for the apparent immorality of mass wealth inequality caused by a hypothetical Artificial General Intelligence agent (AGI). To explore the libertarian response, let’s consider a future in which Jeff Bezos creates an AGI, which now runs the global conglomerate monopoly, formally known as “Amazon.</description>

      <description>The Duty to Drive Given the promise of safer-than-human levels of proficiency, mandating self-driving cars seem like an attractive proposition at face value. The following argument will prove that such a mandate would be a severe violation of man’s right to an agentive life which outweighs its benefits. More importantly, the very acceptance of unsupervised self-driving cars represents a mass abdication of moral responsibility.

      <description>Introduction When the term Artificial Intelligence was coined at the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, the organizers defined AI beyond narrow automata theory or simply solving problems more generally; the explicit intention was to re-create human cognition (McCarthy, 1). Unfortunately, we have considerably strayed from those goals. Today&amp;rsquo;s thinking machines operate well under narrow contexts but fail to accomplish elementary human tasks. Moreover, even in those areas where they work well, they require tremendous resources, and the pace of progress is grinding to a halt (Dellinger, 2).</description>
